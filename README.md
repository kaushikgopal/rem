A super simple TODO app that handles those nonsensical, yet essential todos, that you don't want cluttering your Calendar. This app is intentionally built to be annoying. That is a feature!

I have a much crappier version of the app that I wrote for myself and it has served me well for 6 months. But I gave a talk at DroidCon NYC where I talked about an adaptation of Fowler's Supervising Controller/Passive View patterns for Android. I decided to follow my own advice and rewrite the app in said pattern. The talk was a good primer to understanding the architecture chosen here. [Slides for the talk can be found here](https://speakerdeck.com/kaushikgopal/painless-ui-testing) and [the video is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzXN6iV26wg).


### Current progress:

50% of the app has been ported over 2 weeks (notably written over 1 hour Caltrain rides to work).

I'll probably open source and release the app officially once it's 100% done. I think the pattern is super interesting though and there's a lot of interesting stuff happening in the background, so if you're developer dig in and let me know what you think.

Donn and I will be talking more about this on [Fragmented](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/), so stay tuned for more info!
